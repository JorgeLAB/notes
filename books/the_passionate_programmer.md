> By Chad Fowler


If you want to create a Remarkable Career in Software Development, read this book!

After reading the book, I got some important points useful to you.


### Fulfillment and Happiness 
Fulfillment and happiness in my career don’t (often) come by chane. They require thought, intention, action and willingness to change course when you’re make mistakes.


### Invest in Your Intelligence
Learn new programming language that makes you think a new way.


### Be a Mentor 
Teaching is the best way to learn deeply.
Find an online forum, pick a topic and start helping.


### Practice, Practice, Practice!   
Practice in your limit.

### Be Generalist, Be Specialist


### Automate Yourself in a Job
Pick a task do repeatively, write code generator for it ~> Save time.

Research model-driven architecture (MDA).


### Daily Hit
Keep track your progress by setting a goal (daily, weekly, monthly) and track your accomplishment everyday.


### Marketing yourself
You have only 2 goals: to let people know you exist and to let them know you can solve the touch problems that keep them up at night.


### Change the World
Have a mission. 

Make sure people know it. You need to effect visible change  through your team, company.


### Let your voice be heard
Create list topics. Write and publish articles. Keep writing. Share in social media.

> Companies want to hire experts. While a résumé with a solid list of projects is a good way to demonstrate experience, nothing is better than when the interviewer have already heard of you. It’s especially great if they’ve heard of you because they’ve read your articles or books or they’ve seen you speak at a conference.


### Build your brand
Brand building has two parts: actually making your mark so that people will recognize it and then making sure that mark is associated with positive traits. Recognition and respect.

Your name is your brand.

Google never forget.


### Remarkability
To be remarkable, you have to be significantly different from around you.

Release successful open source software, writing books and articles, and speaking at conferences may all increase your remarkability.

Take 2 hours each week to research new technologies and to start to develop skills in them. Do hands-on (practice) work with these new technologies. Build simple applications.


### Make yourself a Map
Clear where you have been and where you want to be.

Star keeping a jounal. It could be a weblog or personal diary. Write about what you are working on, what you’re learning and your opinion abour industry.


### Better than Yesterday
Make a list improvements you want to archive, they can be personal or professional. Pick the item that make you better than yesterday. Look at list again every morning.


## Action on it:
- Have clear goals and keep track your progress.
- Creating a list topics for blogs. Writing  everyday (notes, tips, tutorials, advice, experiences, courses).
- Creating a list improvements. Take action to be better than yesterday.
- Research new technology and build simple project.
- Learn new language that makes you think new way.
